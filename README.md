# Ludoka :video_game:

Portemanteau of lūdō (to play in Latin) and Judoka (judo practitioner), Ludoka is a web applications for people wishing to see at a quick glance which games they and their friends want to and can play together. The goal is to be able to select a number of players and to be able to tell at first glance which games you have in common -- or don't need to own to play (free games, remote play, etc…) -- and who is interested in playing which.

## Integrations

The first version will have game and player info manually filled in, but the goal is to have various integrations providing game ownership and social circles information. Like using the Steam API both to get game metadata and ownership information, or Discord to be able to select users from your servers.
